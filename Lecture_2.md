# Lecture 2:
## Introduction to parallel computing on the Linux cluster:


  - Pre-requisities:
  
    - Email <can.keles@rhul.ac.uk> for checking whether your access to the cluster is granted. You should be doing this well in advance because it might take IT team.
    - For Mac users use the terminal. Install git on your Mac. An easy installation guide is provided in the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSULlxUk744
    
    - For Windows users install the full version of cmder as a terminal. Download and extract cmder from the link: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/download/v1.3.16/cmder.zip. Inside the extracted folder double-click the cmder executable to launch the terminal. If you need any further help in the installation of cmder, please look at the official installation documentation https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/master/README.md#installation.
    
    - If possible attend Lecture 1, please get yourself familiarized with basic Bash commands and exercises in: https://github.com/RHULPsychology/Important_Tutorials/blob/master/Bash/Important_Commands.md    
    

  - Familiarization with the cluster architecture
  
    In this lecture you would get familiarized with the cluster architecture. (Schematic diagram is shared in https://github.com/RHULPsychology/Important_Tutorials/blob/master/README.md). You whould be able to relate to terms like a login node, a master node and worker nodes. This would be essential to understand how the parallelization would work.
    

 - Basics of how to parallelize processing on the cluster

    This is the practical section that will be covered in the meeting. We will do procedures similar to https://github.com/RHULPsychology/Python_Cluster_Template as practical exercise. Please have a look at github repository the work beforehand and see if it makes sense. Not to worry, the fOllowing topics will be covered in details in the lecture: 
     - submit script
     - call script
     - analysis script
