# Lecture 1:
## Introduction to the Linux cluster, basic BASH commands and git:


  - Pre-requisities:

    - For Mac users use the terminal. 
    - For windows users install the full version of cmder as a terminal. If you need any help in the installation of cmder, please look at the official installation documentation https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/master/README.md#installation.
    - Email <can.keles@rhul.ac.uk> for checking whether your access to the cluster is granted. You should be doing this well in advance because it might take IT team.

  - Familiarization with the cluster architecture
  
    In this lecture you would get familiarized with the cluster architecture image that is shared in https://github.com/RHULPsychology/Important_Tutorials/blob/master/README.md. You whould be able to relate to terms like a login node, a master node and worker nodes. This would be very essential to understand how the parallelization would work.  
    
  - Basic BASH commands:
  
    Learn basic Bash Scripting. Please follow tutorials and exercises provided at https://github.com/RHULPsychology/Important_Tutorials/blob/master/Bash/Important_Commands.md.
    

  - Git usage on the cluster
  
    You would use the following command to update git on the cluster. 

  ```bash
      source /usr/local/apps/psycapps/config/conda_bash_update
  ```

    You would be able to fork a repository from github or create a new repo in github, clone it on the cluster, make changes, git add, git commit and git pull and git push from the command line. It is very important for any further steps. Please refer to the tutorials mentioned in https://github.com/RHULPsychology/Important_Tutorials/blob/master/Git/Important_Links.md
