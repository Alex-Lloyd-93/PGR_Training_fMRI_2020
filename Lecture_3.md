  - Heudiconv on cluster
  
    This section will be done as a practical during the meeting. Although it would be covered in details in the lecture, It would help if you could familiarize yourself with the heudiconv scripts that we will use on the cluster. It is available at https://github.com/RHULPsychology/HeudiConv_BIDS_conversion
